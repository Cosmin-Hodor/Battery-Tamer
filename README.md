To make the script executable, you can save it and then run the following command: `chmod +x battery-tamer.sh`. 

This will allow you to run the script as an executable file.

If you need to stop the script from running, you can use the command: `pkill -f battery-tamer.sh`. 

This will terminate the script and prevent it from running any further.
